SAMPLE 2: SRT-MGATE-1210 - Manufacturing/IT Director
================================================================================
To: justin.moore@nov.com
Name: Justin Moore (IT Security Director)
Company: NOV
Subject: SRT-MGATE-1210: Industrial Modbus-to-MQTT Gateway
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Justin,

I'm reaching out regarding our SRT-MGATE-1210, an Industrial Modbus-to-MQTT
Gateway designed for modern IIoT connectivity.

Key features that set us apart:
- **BLE Mobile Configuration** - Setup via smartphone in 5 minutes
- **WiFi Auto Failover** - Automatic switch from Ethernet to WiFi
- **RTC with Battery Backup** - Accurate timestamps even after power loss
- **Industrial Grade** - Operating temp -40C to +75C

At Rp 2,700,000 (~$169), we're 20-70% more affordable than USR-IOT, BLIIoT,
ICP DAS, and Moxa - while offering features they don't have.

Given NOV's operations, this could streamline your Modbus device connectivity
to cloud platforms like AWS, Grafana, or our SURGE Platform.

Would you be interested in a technical demo or product samples?

Best regards,
SURIOTA Technical Sales
